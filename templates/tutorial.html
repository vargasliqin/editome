<p><b>Gene</b>: Overlapping gene<br>
<b>Strand</b>: + for positive strand, - for negative strand (with respect to reference genome)<br>
<b>Genic Region</b>: Functional location within the transcript. If edit is located with a coding sequence, the predicted amino acid variation is also shown. <br>
<b>Repetitive Element</b>: Specifies whether the editing site is located in an Alu repeat, non-Alu repeat, or nonrepetitive region of the genome.<br>
<b>Conservation of Edit</b>: Species in which editing is known to be conserved. Clicking on this field links to the editing site in the UCSC browser for the selected species, showing the overlapping genes and genomic nucleotide conservation<br>
<b>Reference</b>: Study in which the editing site was identified. Clicking on this link redirects to the pubmed reference.<br>
<b>Editing Levels</b>: If RNA-seq data is available for this editing site, clicking on this link will provide tissue-specific editing levels:</p>
